Parking Lot Management System
As we know, due to increase in number of cars and limited spots ,parking the cars is getting difficult. In metropolitan cities, car parking has become a major concern in all busy areas, and a good traffic system need a good parking system. In this project ,we have made a system where it is possible to reserve a parking spot ahead in time as to reduce the need to search parking spots and the unnecessary rush. This parking lot does not require a parking attendant. It will save a lot our time and it keeps all the records properly.The system has backup files and the system is secured.
